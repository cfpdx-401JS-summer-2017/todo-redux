Todo Redux
===

Create a redux TODO app, of the cannonical [TODOMVC](http://todomvc.com/) variety. There are many, many, many examples on internet to guide you along.

Do **NOT** copy and try and adapt the code that you see.

**Do** build your own and get inspiration and ideas and help from the code that you find online.
